# Jam's Portfolio Site

This is my portfolio website built in Next.js React (using typescript)

This can be treated as a template for your own portfolio, but for now, this is in `beta` state. There are still features I would like to add / improve on.

## Tasks
- [x] Landing Page
- [x] Personal Blog
- [ ] Self-made CMS
- [ ] Fix fetch component

# Plans for the future

I am planning on making an open-source, customizable CMS using Next.js as the front-end & Supabase as the PostgresDB.

I plan on intergrating the `Astro` framework in my portfolio, to give me flexibility on what kind of framework I want to use. 

I also plan on implementing docker in the future, but it is very unlikely and will depend on multiple circumstances.
